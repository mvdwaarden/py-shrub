Absolutely! I can add more advanced Azure Pipeline features and provide a PDF with all the information. Here's a breakdown of the advanced features we'll include in the mapping:

### Advanced Feature Mappings:
1. **Parallel Execution (Python Threads/Async)**
2. **Service Connections (Python API Requests)**
3. **Pipeline Artifacts (Python File Handling/Storage)**
4. **Approval Gates (Python Exception Handling with Custom Logic)**
5. **Environment Variables (Python Environment Variables)**
6. **Triggers (Python Event Handling)**
7. **Template Reuse (Python Modular Code/Function Libraries)**

Once I complete the content, I'll generate a PDF with the full mapping for you.

Let me first put the advanced features in the context of Python and Azure Pipelines:

---

### 1. **Parallel Execution (Python Threads/Async)**
   **Python Threading/Async Example:**

   ```python
   import threading
   
   def task_1():
       print("Task 1")
   
   def task_2():
       print("Task 2")
   
   thread1 = threading.Thread(target=task_1)
   thread2 = threading.Thread(target=task_2)
   
   thread1.start()
   thread2.start()
   ```

   **Azure Pipeline YAML (Parallel Execution with Jobs):**

   Azure Pipelines allows parallel job execution. Each job runs on its own environment (VM):

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     - job: Job1
       pool:
         vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
       steps:
         - script: echo "Task 1"
     
     - job: Job2
       pool:
         vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
       steps:
         - script: echo "Task 2"
   ```

   You can also execute multiple tasks in parallel within a single job using the `parallel` keyword.

---

### 2. **Service Connections (Python API Requests)**
   **Python API Request:**

   ```python
   import requests

   response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', auth=('user', 'pass'))
   print(response.json())
   ```

   **Azure Pipeline YAML (Service Connections):**

   In Azure Pipelines, you use service connections for external API calls:

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - task: HttpRequest@2
       inputs:
         method: 'GET'
         url: 'https://api.example.com/data'
         authenticationType: 'UsernamePassword'
         username: $(serviceUsername)
         password: $(servicePassword)
   ```

---

### 3. **Pipeline Artifacts (Python File Handling/Storage)**
   **Python File Handling:**

   ```python
   with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
       file.write("This is an output file.")
   ```

   **Azure Pipeline YAML (Artifact Storage):**

   Azure Pipelines uses **Artifacts** to store build outputs, which can be consumed by subsequent stages:

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
       inputs:
         PathtoPublish: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/output.txt'
         ArtifactName: 'outputFiles'
         publishLocation: 'Container'
     
     - task: DownloadBuildArtifacts@0
       inputs:
         artifactName: 'outputFiles'
         downloadPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
   ```

---

### 4. **Approval Gates (Python Exception Handling with Custom Logic)**
   **Python Custom Exception Handling:**

   ```python
   try:
       # Some code
   except SomeException as e:
       # Custom logic
   ```

   **Azure Pipeline YAML (Approval Gates):**

   Azure Pipelines allows you to set up approval gates to ensure manual or automated approval before proceeding to the next stage:

   ```yaml
   stages:
     - stage: Build
       jobs:
         - job: BuildJob
           steps:
             - script: echo "Building"
     
     - stage: Deploy
       dependsOn: Build
       condition: succeeded()
       jobs:
         - job: DeployJob
           steps:
             - script: echo "Deploying"
   
   resources:
     pipelines:
       - pipeline: Build
         source: 'MyBuildPipeline'
         trigger: 
           branches:
             include:
               - main
   ```

   In this scenario, you can also use **approvals** to trigger certain stages only after approval by specific users.

---

### 5. **Environment Variables (Python Environment Variables)**
   **Python Environment Variables:**

   ```python
   import os

   print(os.getenv('MY_VARIABLE'))
   ```

   **Azure Pipeline YAML (Environment Variables):**

   In Azure Pipelines, environment variables can be defined in YAML or set for specific steps:

   ```yaml
   variables:
     myVariable: 'HelloWorld'

   steps:
     - script: echo $(myVariable)
       displayName: 'Print variable'
   
   jobs:
     - job: ExampleJob
       pool:
         vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
       steps:
         - script: echo $(MY_VARIABLE)
           env:
             MY_VARIABLE: 'CustomValue'
   ```

---

### 6. **Triggers (Python Event Handling)**
   **Python Event Handling Example:**

   ```python
   def on_event(event):
       print(f"Handling event: {event}")

   # Event is triggered
   on_event("BuildStarted")
   ```

   **Azure Pipeline YAML (Triggers):**

   Azure Pipelines provides triggers to start a pipeline based on events, such as changes in source control:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
     branches:
       include:
         - main
     paths:
       include:
         - '**/*.cs'
   
   pr:
     branches:
       include:
         - develop
   ```

   You can set triggers to run when code is pushed to specific branches or when a pull request is made.

---

### 7. **Template Reuse (Python Modular Code/Function Libraries)**
   **Python Modular Code (Importing Code from Other Files):**

   ```python
   from mymodule import my_function

   result = my_function()
   ```

   **Azure Pipeline YAML (Template Reuse):**

   Azure Pipelines supports reusable templates. You can define a template and reference it in multiple pipelines:

   ```yaml
   # template.yml
   steps:
     - script: echo "This is a reusable step."

   # main-pipeline.yml
   steps:
     - template: template.yml
   ```

Now that we have the full content, I will create a PDF that contains all the mappings for you. Give me a moment!
